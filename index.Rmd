## Project thoughts

I am interested in exploring data related to identity, specifically the Hispanic/Latinx identity in the United States.This data set from the Pew Research Center analyzes how individuals with Hispanic/Latinx ancestry do or do not identify with the terms. 

This is of particular interest to me as a dual citizen with Brazil (where my grandfather is from). I myself tend to identify as white -- especially if the only two options are 'white, not hispanic/latino' or 'hispanic/latino', and if there is no overlap between the two.
